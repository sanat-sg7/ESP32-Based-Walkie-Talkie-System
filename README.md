# ESP32-Based-Walkie-Talkie-System
This project aims to design and implement a Walkie Talkie using ESP32, MAX Audio Amplifier and I2S Microphone and Speaker. Walkie Talkie is a wireless communication device that enables two or more people to communicate over a short distance. The device is widely used in various applications such as military, police, construction, event management, etc.

# The project consists of the following components:
•	 ESP32 Microcontroller

•	 PAM8403 Audio Amplifier

•	 I2S MEMS Microphone

•	 Speaker

•	 Power Supply

# Software Design:
The software for the Walkie-Talkie project is developed using the Arduino IDE. The program is written in C++ language. The program includes the following functions:
•	 Initializing the I2S interface for the microphone and speaker

•	 Setting up the MAX Audio Amplifier

•	 Reading and processing the audio signal from the microphone

•	 Transmitting the audio signal over the wireless communication protocol ESP-NOW

•	 Receiving the audio signal from the other walkie-talkie device

•	 Playing the received audio signal on the speaker
